## About The Project

The task for this competition will be classifying noisy images. The dataset consists of 50k images for training where we provide the label, and 10k images for testing where we do not provide the label.

The color (3-channel RGB) images are of size 32x32. The images are corrupted by noise that follows a Bernoulli distribution, and is similar to impulse noise. You can consider the noise as dead pixels in an image and the values are always 0.

Here are a few exemples:
